# Tinyplanet

Quick experiment in making tinyplanet images from non-ideal panoramas.

## Rationale

In order to make a good tinyplanet image, you normally need a level horizon,
otherwise your planet will have an unsightly fault:

![tinyplanet with uncorrected horizon, showing a sudden jump where the two ends join](examples/planets/no-horizon-correction.png)

An uneven horizon may be due to the camera not being entirely level throughout the taking of the photo, or the panorama may contain uneven ground, and not be exactly 360ยบ.

![source image, a panorama on a terraced hill](examples/panoramas/crooked-horizon.jpg)

If the height difference between the ends of the horizon is great enough, simply rotating the whole image
to fit causes extreme wonkiness in the output.

![tinyplanet with source image rotated to align the horizon, eliminating the sudden jump, but everything now bends clockwise](examples/planets/rotated.png)

The technique used here gradually corrects the horizon alignment from the centre of the image to a mid-point between the two horizons.  This produces a better result.
